# Design Principle

The idea behind the syntax of the natrium programming language is to carry the simple syntax of basic or lua, and make it slightly more descriptive. This means that using the correct naming conventions for variables, the program will be extremely readable, with no quirks in the syntax.

# Syntax for the syntax

The "natrium.rbnf" file contains the official grammar and notations for the natrium programming language. The contents of the file are written using the BNF (Backus-Naur Form) along with a hint of regular expressions, wherever necessary and hence the extension "rbnf"

# Running programs

The programs built with natrium can be run both on the natrium interpreter or as native binaries, using the compiler. Currently, 86x64 linux is supported, but support for other platforms may be added in the future
